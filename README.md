# Team-Profile-Generator
## Description
- The motivation for this project was to be able to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
- This project helped me to get more comfortable with node.js and inquirer, as well as, introducing me to class constructors.
- This project also introduced me to jest, a javascript testing framework to begin writing basic tests to validate my code.
